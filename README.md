Lab Phase Project Draft: Taskify
Project Name: Taskify
Developer: Brian Okech Wade (Working Individually)
Project Type: Solo Project

1. Project Concept:
Taskify is a personal task management web application designed to help users organize their daily tasks, set priorities, and track their productivity. It will provide a clean, intuitive interface for managing a personal to-do list.

2. Core Features (Planned):

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.

CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

Read: View a list of all tasks.

Update: Edit task details and mark tasks as complete/incomplete.

Delete: Remove tasks from the list.

Task Organization: Categorize tasks (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Urgent").

Interactive UI: A dynamic front-end that updates without requiring a full page refresh.

Data Persistence: All tasks and user data will be stored in a database.

3. Proposed Technology Stack:

Frontend: React.js (or HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or Python with Flask/Django)

Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)

Other Tools: Git for version control.

4. Next Steps (With Instructor's Assistance):

Finalize the technology stack based on project scope and learning objectives.

Create a detailed project timeline and milestone plan.

Set up the initial project repository and development environment.

Design the database schema.

Review the architecture and plan for potential stretch goals (e.g., drag-and-drop functionality, reminders, etc.).
